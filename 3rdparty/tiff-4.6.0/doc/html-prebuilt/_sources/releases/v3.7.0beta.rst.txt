This document describes the changes made to the software between the
*previous* and *current* versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.
The following information is located here:


Major changes
-------------

* LZW compression enabled by default. You don't need the separate
  compression kit anymore.

* :program:`bmp2tiff`: Added new utility to convert Windows BMP files
  into TIFFs.

* The first attempt to implement a test suite.


Software configuration changes
------------------------------

* Many portability fixes in the new autotooled build suite.


Library changes
---------------

* :file:`libtiff/tif_luv.c`, :file:`libtiff/tif_next.c`, :file:`libtiff/tif_thunder.c`:
  Several buffer overruns fixed, as noted by Chris Evans.

* BSD data types (:c:type:`u_char`, :c:type:`u_short`, :c:type:`u_int`, :c:type:`u_long`)
  is no longer used internally in the libtiff. Should result in simpler configuration
  and better portability.

* :file:`libtiff/tiff.h`: Fix column tagging. Reference current Adobe XMP
  specification. Reference libtiff bug tracking system to submit
  private tag additions.

* :file:`libtiff/tif_dirread.c`: Don't reject to read tags of the
  ``SamplesPerPixel`` size when the tag count is greater than number of
  samples as per bug
  :bugzilla-rs:`576`.

* :file:`libtiff/tiffio.h`, :file:`libtiff/tif_open.c`: Applied patches from
  Joris Van Damme  to avoid requirement for :file:`tiffiop.h` inclusion in
  some applications. Look for details here:
  `<http://www.asmail.be/msg0054799560.html>`_.

* :file:`libtiff/tiffiop.h`, :file:`libtiff/tif_dirinfo.c`: Fixed problem with the static
  variable as per bug
  :bugzilla-rs:`593`.
  
* :file:`libtiff/tif_lzw.c`: LZW compression code is merged back from the
  separate package. All libtiff tools are updated to not advertise an
  absence of LZW support.

* :file:`libtiff/tif_dir.c`: Call :c:func:`TIFFError` instead of producing warnings
  when setting custom tags by value. Reported by Eric Fieleke.


Tools changes
-------------

* :program:`tiff2ps`: Avoid zero division in :c:func:`setupPageState` function;
  properly initialize array in :c:func:`PSDataBW`.

* :program:`tiff2pdf`: Multiple bugfixes.

* :program:`ras2tiff`:  Fixed issue with missed big-endian checks as per bug
  :bugzilla-rs:`586`.

* :program:`bmp2tiff`: Added new utility to convert Windows BMP files
  into TIFFs.


Contributed software changes

LZW compression kit changes
---------------------------

* This one is not longer needed.
