\page apps JasPer Application Programs

\section app_intro Introduction

In order to demonstrate how the JasPer library can be used, several sample
application programs are provided in the JasPer software distribution.
These programs include the following:

  - `jasper`.
    The `jasper` program is an image transcoder (i.e., it converts image data
    from one format to another).
    For more details, see \subpage apps_jasper.

  - `jiv`.
    The `jiv` program is a simple image viewer (based on OpenGL).
    For more details, see \subpage apps_jiv.

  - `imgcmp`
    The `imgcmp` program is an image comparison utility.
    It measures the difference between two images using one of numerous
    distortion metrics (such as peak signal-to-noise ratio, mean squared error,
    root mean squared error, peak absolute error, and mean absolute error).
    For more details, see \subpage apps_imgcmp.

  - `imginfo`
    The `imginfo` program provides basic information about an image,
    such as its geometry (i.e., number of components, width and height of
    components, and so on).
    For more details, see \subpage apps_imginfo.

Although the above-mentioned programs were initially developed for
demonstration purposes, they have also proven quite useful in their own
right, especially the `jasper` and `jiv` programs.
