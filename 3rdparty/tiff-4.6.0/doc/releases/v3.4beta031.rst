This document describes the changes made to the software between the
*previous* and *current* versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.
The following information is located here:


Software configuration changes
------------------------------

* :program:`configure` now captures significantly more information
  in the :file:`config.log` file and provides more information when
  it is unable to setup a configuration
* support was added for building shared libraries on more systems:
  AIX, HPUX, Solaris, and Linux.
* a new configuration parameter ``LIBCOPTS`` was added for
  passing arguments to the C compiler to use when building only
  the library; this is part of the enhanced support for building
  shared libraries
* include files for optional packages that reside in :file:`/usr/include`
  are now handled correctly
* build trees may now be configured using either relative or absolute
  pathnames to the source distribution
* several new configuration parameters were added, mainly for building
  shared libraries: ``DIST_MAJOR``, ``DIST_MINOR``, 
  ``DIST_ALPHA``, and ``DSOSUF_VERSION``


Library changes
---------------

* the Deflate support has been revised: it requires version 0.99 of
  the zlib software distribution, **the output format has changed and
  is incompatible with previous versions of this library** (each
  strip now includes a header read and written by the zlib library)
* the codec name printed by the :c:func:`TIFFPrintDirectory` routine is now
  taken from the codec table instead of from a builtin table; this means
  that application-defined codecs are handled correctly
* a new symbol was added that contains the library version number;
  this can be used to do a compile-time compatibility check of the
  library version

Documentation changes
---------------------

* the creation and installation of manual pages was redone; it now
  implements the documented "configuration scheme"
