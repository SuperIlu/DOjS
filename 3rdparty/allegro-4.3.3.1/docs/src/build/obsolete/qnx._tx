QNX notes

   Status: it works. Only annoying bug left seems to be the display switching
   in fullscreen mode; just don't try to change workspace while in fullscreen
   or your program will crash... Also, video bitmaps and hardware acceleration
   are still not yet implemented.



@heading
Required software

   The library works with QNX 6.0 RTP. You need the development tools
   installed on your system; if you don't have them, you can get them from the
   QNX online repository using the Package Manager.



@heading
Installing Allegro

   As Allegro is a multiplatform library, you first need to set it up for use
   on QNX RTP, by running:
<textblock>
      chmod +x fix.sh
      ./fix.sh qnx
<endblock>
   Now you may want to generate the dependencies; this step is optional if
   you are using an official release, but it is required if you got a SVN
   snapshot of the library.
<textblock>
      make depend
<endblock>
   Then you need to build Allegro:
<textblock>
      make
<endblock>
   And finally install it (you need to be root for this):
<textblock>
      su -c "make install"
<endblock>
   Installing the library will copy the header files to <tt>/usr/include</tt>, the
   library file to <tt>/usr/lib</tt> and the <tt>allegro-config</tt> script into <tt>/usr/bin</tt>.
   
   

@heading
Using Allegro

   Linking with Allegro requires you to link also other libraries to your
   executables. To avoid you having to work out the right linker commands for
   yourself, the installation creates a script, <tt>allegro-config</tt>, that will
   print out a suitable commandline. You can use this inside a backtick 
   command substitution, for example:
<textblock>
      gcc myfile.c -o myprogram `allegro-config --libs`
<endblock>
   Or if you want to build a debug version of your program, assuming that 
   you have installed the debug version of Allegro:
<textblock>
      gcc myfile.c -o myprogram `allegro-config --libs debug`
<endblock>
   Unix newbies, take note that these are ` backticks, not normal ' quotes!

   There are also switches for printing out the Allegro version number and
   overriding the install paths. Run <tt>allegro-config</tt> without any arguments
   for a full list of options.

   Don't forget that you need to use the <code>END_OF_MAIN()</code> macro right after
   your <code>main()</code> function!



@heading
Final notes

   Allegro for QNX requires you to be running the Photon MicroGUI environment;
   if Photon cannot be found, the library will fail to initialize. If this
   happens, you're probably in a text console; just run "<tt>ph</tt>" to start Photon.
