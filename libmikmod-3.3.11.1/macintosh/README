  Hello folks !


This is libmikmod, version 3.3.11, a portable sound library for Unix.
Check out the file 'NEWS' for more history information.


>> BUILDING LIBMIKMOD
---------------------

- If you're not building libmikmod for the Macintosh, then you're lost
  in the sources. Go up one directory, and read the main README file.

- If you are building for Mac OS X only, you might want to look at the
  top-level "macosx" directory instead which has the new Mach-O stuff ?

libmikmod can be built using Metrowerks Codewarrior (Version Pro 5/6
were being used to create the two project files) or Apple's MPW.

Read the file INSTALL in this directory for compilation instructions.
The projects will generate code for 68k as well as PowerPC processors.

HTML documentation of the library, for programmers, is located in the
doc directory.

For more information on this port, please contact Anders Bjoerklund

>> THANKS
---------

We would like to thank everyone who contributed to libmikmod. Their
names are in the AUTHORS file for the significative contributions, but
some other names can be found in the NEWS file. Thanks a lot ! Keeping
libmikmod alive wouldn't be much fun without you.
