BCC32 notes

   Status: it works.  It currently doesn't build the Allegro library
   from the sources, but it does let you compile your own Allegro-based
   programs and run them with the Allegro DLLs.  Thanks to Inprise for
   creating the very useful IMPLIB program. 

   The screensaver example is built, but you must copy <tt>scrsave.scr</tt> to
   your <tt>windows/system</tt> directory (or <tt>winnt/system32</tt> directory
   under Windows NT/2k/XP) if you want to test it.



@heading
Required software

   <ul><li>Borland C++Builder (or Borland C++ command line tools)
   <li>Recent set of DirectX and other Windows SDK headers.
   <li>GNU make 3.77 or higher.
   <li>Optional: GNU sed. Used by "<tt>make depend</tt>" and "<tt>fixdll.bat</tt>".
   <li>Optional: GNU sort (not DOS sort). Used by "<tt>fixdll.bat</tt>".
</ul>
   In order to run your programs, you need to obtain the Allegro DLLs and
   install them in the Windows system directory.

   This is known to work with the Borland C++ 5.5 command line compiler.
   Earlier versions may cause problems (for example v5.02).

   You need to use GNU make, since Borland make is really ugly about its
   makefiles. You can grab it from either the MinGW or DJGPP
   distributions; more info on this in available in the following files:
   <tt>docs/build/mingw32.txt</tt> and <tt>docs/build/djgpp.txt</tt>.



@heading
Installing Allegro

   Set up your environment so that Borland C++ can be used from the
   commandline. Then set the variable BCC32DIR to the directory where
   Borland C++ is located, for example '<tt>set BCC32DIR=c:\bcc32</tt>'.

   Type "<tt>cd allegro</tt>" and then "<tt>fix.bat bcc32</tt>".  Then, run "<tt>make</tt>".  Find
   something fun to do while it's compiling.  It will eventually
   finish; then just type "<tt>make install</tt>" to set the library up for use.

   If you also want to install a debugging version of the library (highly 
   recommended), type "<tt>make install DEBUGMODE=1</tt>".  Case is important, so 
   it must be <tt>DEBUGMODE</tt>, not <tt>debugmode</tt>!

   If you also want to install a profiling version of the library, now type 
   "<tt>make install PROFILEMODE=1</tt>".

   If your copy of Allegro doesn't include the makefile.dep dependency files 
   (unlikely, unless you have run "<tt>make veryclean</tt>" at some point), you can 
   regenerate them by running "<tt>make depend</tt>".

   If your copy of Allegro doesn't include the linker .def file (unlikely, 
   unless you have run "<tt>make veryclean</tt>" at some point), you can regenerate 
   it by running "<tt>misc\fixdll.bat</tt>".



@heading
Using Allegro

   All the Allegro functions, variables, and data structures are defined in 
   <tt>allegro.h</tt>. You should include this in your programs, and link with one of
   the libraries:
<textblock>
      alleg.lib      - optimised DLL import library
      alld.lib       - debugging DLL import library
      allp.lib       - profiling DLL import library
<endblock>
   Don't forget that you need to use the <code>END_OF_MAIN()</code> macro right after
   your <code>main()</code> function!

   You will need to distribute the appropriate DLL along with your program.
