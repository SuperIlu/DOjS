This document describes the changes made to the software between the
*previous* and *current* versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.
The following information is located here:


Software configuration changes
------------------------------

* configure now recognizes IRIX 6.x systems
* configure now uses ``ENVOPTS`` when searching for an ANSI
  C compiler; this fixes a problem configuring the software under
  HP/UX with the native C compiler
* configure now correctly recognizes memory-mapped files are supported
  under AIX


Library changes
---------------

* ``make install`` now properly installs the include files
* some portability fixes from Bjorn Brox
* the G3/G4 codec now warns about decoded rows that are longer than
  the image/tile width
* changes from Frank Cringle to make the library work with the
  gcc-specific bounds checking software
* miscellaneous fixes to :c:func:`TIFFPrintDirectory`
* bug fix to correct a problem where :c:func:`TIFFWriteRawStrip`
  could not be used to automatically grow an image's length


Tools changes
-------------

* fixes from Frank Cringle to update :program:`fax2tiff`
* portability fixes to :program:`tiff2bw` and :program:`tiffcmp`
* :program:`tiffdump` now uses the byte swapping routines in the library
