\page bugs Bug Tracking and Reporting

All bugs reported in JasPer are tracked using the issue-tracking
functionality provided by GitHub.  If you encounter a problem with
JasPer and you would like to know if it is a known problem, please
check the issue-tracker page for JasPer on GitHub, which can be found at:

  - https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues

If you happen to find a bug that has not been previously reported,
please report it so that it can be fixed.
To submit a bug report, visit the above issue-tracker page,
and click on the "New issue" button.

In order to ensure that your bug report can be properly processed,
always be sure to include **all** of the following information:

  - The version of JasPer in which the problem was found.

  - The details of the run-time system (i.e., operating system,
    version number).

  - The compiler that you are using (i.e., vendor, version number).

  - The exact command line options used when the problem was observed.

  - Indicate whether or not the problem is reproducible.  If the
    problem is reproducible, indicate the exact steps required to
    reproduce the problem.

  - A detailed description of the problem that you are experiencing.

It is essential that you include all of the above information.
Failure to do so may result in the bug report not being processed.

Please do not submit bug reports directly to the author of JasPer
via email, as bug reports that are not submitted via the above
issue-tracking system on GitHub are easy to be lost.
