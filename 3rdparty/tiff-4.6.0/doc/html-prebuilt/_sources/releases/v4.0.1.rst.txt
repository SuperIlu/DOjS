This document describes the changes made to the software between the
*previous* and *current* versions (see above).  If you don't
find something listed here, then it was not done in this timeframe, or
it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.  The following
information is located here:


Major changes
-------------

* None


Software configuration changes
------------------------------

* ``--enable-ld-version-script``: New :program:`configure` option to
  enable shared library symbol versioning on ELF-based systems
  (e.g. Linux and FreeBSD) which use the GNU linker.  This
  allows multiple major versions of libtiff to be loaded
  simultaneously into the same application or library without
  conflict, as long as all libtiffs involved are built with
  versioned symbols.  This option is not enabled by default.

* Added libtiff private dependency on ``-llzma`` for pkg-config.


Library changes
---------------

* :file:`libtiff/tif_dir.c`, :file:`libtiff/tif_dirread.c`: Extra caution around
  assumption tag fetching is always successful.

* :file:`libtiff/tif_jpeg.c`: Extra caution for case where :c:var:`sp` is :c:macro:`NULL`.


Tools changes
-------------

* None


Contributed software changes
----------------------------

* None
