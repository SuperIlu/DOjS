echo Note: this is not a full Mingw32 port of the Allegro library. This makefile
echo will create an import library and build all the test programs using Mingw32,
echo but the library code lives in a DLL that is built with MSVC. If you haven't
echo already got the DLL, run "fixmsvc" and then "make install" to build it.
