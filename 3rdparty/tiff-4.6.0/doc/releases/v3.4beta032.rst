This document describes the changes made to the software between the
*previous* and *current* versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.
The following information is located here:


Software configuration changes
------------------------------

* various fixups and subtle improvements to :program:`configure`
  from Richard Mlynarik


Library changes
---------------

* a new codec from Pixar designed for high-resolution color images;
  note that this codec is not configured by default
* a bug fix for reading tags with a single ``FLOAT`` value
* change to the :c:func:`TIFFGetField` calling convention:
  a tag that has a single value of
  type ``DOUBLE`` is now retrieved by passing a
  ``double*`` instead of a
  ``double**`` (this change makes the handling of tags with
  ``DOUBLE`` values identical to the handling of tags with
  ``FLOAT`` values)
* fix to VMS support for the handling of floating point values


Tools changes
-------------

* :program:`tiffdump` now handles tags with ``FLOAT`` and ``DOUBLE``
  values


Contributed software changes
----------------------------

* updates to the Acorn OS support from Peter Greenham
