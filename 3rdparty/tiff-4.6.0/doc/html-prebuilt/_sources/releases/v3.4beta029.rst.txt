This document describes the changes made to the software between the
*previous* and *current* versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.
The following information is located here:


Software configuration changes
------------------------------

* :program:`configure` now relativizes pathname references given in
  "``-L``" options (as frequently specified when configuring
  ancillary packages)
* problems related to configuring the software on Ultrix 4.4 have
  been corrected
* the shell to use in Makefiles and scripts can now be set with the
  ``SCRIPT_SH`` configuration parameter
* comments in :file:`config.site` now correctly indicate how to setup the
  use of ancillary packages


Library changes
---------------

* mods for building the software on a Mac using the
  MetroWerks CodeWarrior compilers
* a bug in the CCITT T.4/T.6 decoder was fixed where the last codeword in
  a strip/tile might not be decoded; this was seen only when decoding
  multi-strip images
* a bug in the CCITT RLE codecs was fixed whereby the pseudo tags were not
  being properly registered


Contributed software changes
----------------------------

* :file:`contrib/mac-cw` contains information and code from `Niles Ritter
  <ndr@tazboy.jpl.nasa.gov>`_
  about building the software with the MetroWerks CodeWarrior compilers
  on Macintosh systems
