\subsection app__jiv__synopsis Synopsis

\c jiv [options] [file1 file2 ...]

\subsection app__jiv__desc Description

The jiv command displays an image.
Basic pan and zoom functionality is provided.
Components of an image may be viewed individually.
Color components may also be viewed together as a composite image.
At present, the jiv image viewer has only trivial support for color.
It recognizes RGB and YCbCr color spaces, but does not use tone
reproduction curves and the like in order to accurately reproduce color.
For basic testing purposes, however, the color reproduction should suffice.
