Description:    A DOS JavaScript Canvas with sound
Summary:        DOjS is a JavaScript-able canvas with WAV and MIDI sound support. DOjS runs in Dosbox and on real hardware or a virtual machine with MS-DOS, FreeDOS or any DOS based Windows like Windows 95/98/ME. If you run it on real hardware you need at least a 80386 with 4MB. I recommend a Pentium class machine (>= 100MHz) with at least 32MB RAM.
