# Version information is taken from configure.ac
# Note: Single command "cmake --build . --target tiff_release"
#       does not work correctly, because version information is taken from CMakeCache.txt,
#       which is not updated by cmake --build.
#       Therefore, force CMake re-configure if configure.ac has changed.
#       By the way, release-date and VERSION will not change but only when --targt tiff_release is called.
