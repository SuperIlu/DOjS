This document describes the changes made to the software between the
*previous* and *current* versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this

Major changes
-------------

* Maintenance release. Many bugfixes in the build environment
  and compatibility improvements.


Software configuration changes
------------------------------

* :file:`configure.ac`: Use ``-rpath`` option instead of ``-R`` as per bug
  :bugzilla-rs:`732`

* :file:`tif_stream.cxx`: Fixes for C++ stream interface from

* :file:`configure.ac`: Make the documentation directory location
  configurable via the ``--with-docdir`` option (as suggested by
  Jeremy C. Reed).

* Place the C++ stream API in the separate library called
  ``libtiffxx`` to avoid unneeded dependencies. Probably there will be
  more C++ API in the future. As per bugs
  :bugzilla-rs:`733`
  and :bugzilla-rs:`730`

  (34911) used in HylaFax software. As per bug
  :bugzilla-rs:`771`

* :file:`tif_open.c`: Remove unnecessary :c:func:`TIFFSeekFile` call as per

  suspicious values in the tags. As per bugs
  :bugzilla-rs:`705`
  and :bugzilla-rs:`320`

* :file:`tif_color.c`: Use double as the second argument of :c:func:`pow`
  function in :c:func:`TIFFCIELabToRGBInit`. As per bug

  as per bug
  :bugzilla-rs:`785`

* :file:`fax2ps.c`: Replace insecure :c:func:`mktemp` function with the
  :c:func:`tmpfile` as per bug
  :bugzilla-rs:`786`
