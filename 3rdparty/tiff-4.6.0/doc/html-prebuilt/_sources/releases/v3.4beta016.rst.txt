This document describes the changes made to the software between the
*previous* and *current* versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.
The following information is located here:


Software configuration changes
------------------------------

* support was added for configuring the Deflate codec
* support was added for the HTML documentation
* codecs that are not configured for inclusion in the library
  are no longer compiled


Library changes
---------------

* support was added for registering new codecs external to the library
  and for overriding the codecs that are builtin to the library
* emulation support for the old ``DataType`` tag was improved
* support was added for the ``SMinSampleValue``
  and ``SMaxSampleValue`` tags
* the library no longer ignores ``TileWidth`` and ``TileLength``
  tags whose values are not a multiple of 16 (per the spec); this
  permits old, improperly written, images to be read
* the support for the ``Predictor`` tag was placed in a reusable
  module so that it can be shared by multiple codecs
* experimental compression support was added for the Deflate algorithm
  (using the freely available zlib package)
* a new routine, :c:func:`TIFFWriteBufferSetup` was added Ã  la the
  routine :c:func:`TIFFReadBufferSetup`
* the DSO version of the library is now statically linked with the
  JPEG and Deflate libraries; this means applications that link against
  the DSO do not also need to link against these ancillary libraries


Tools changes
-------------

* all the tools now use common code to process compress-oriented arguments
* :program:`tiffdump` should now compile on a Macintosh with MPW


Documentation changes
---------------------

* everything was updated


Contributed software changes
----------------------------

* :file:`contrib/dbs/xtiff` was made to compile
* :file:`contrib/mac-mpw` is new support for compiling the software on
  a Macintosh under MPW
* :file:`contrib/tags` is information on how to use the tag extenion
  facilities; consult :file:`contrib/tags/README` for details
