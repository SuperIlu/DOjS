  ======================  ==========================================

This document describes the changes made to the software between the
*previous* and *current* versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.
The following information is located here:


Software configuration changes
------------------------------

* bit order was corrected for Pentium systems
* a new define, :c:macro:`HOST_BIGENDIAN`, was added for code that
  wants to statically use information about native cpu byte order


Library changes
---------------

* the G3/G4 decoder was replaced by a new one that is faster and
  has smaller state tables
* Niles Ritter's client tag extension hooks were added
* a new routine :c:func:`TIFFCurrentDirOffset` was added for
  applications that want to find out the file offset of a TIFF directory
* the calculation of the number of strips in an image was corrected
  for images with certain esoteric configurations
* a potential memory leak (very unlikely) was plugged
* the ``TIFFReadRGBAImage`` support was completely rewritten
  and new, more flexible support was added for reading images into
  a fixed-format raster
* YCbCr to RGB conversion done in the :c:func:`TIFFReadRGBAImage` support
  was optimized
* a bug in JPEG support calculation of strip size was corrected
* the LZW decoder was changed to initialize the code table to zero
  to lessen potential problems that arise when invalid data is decoded
* :c:func:`tiffcomp.h` is now aware of OS/2
* some function prototypes in :file:`tiffio.h` and :file:`tiffiop.h`
  that contained parameter names have been changed to avoid complaints
  from certain compilers


Portability support changes
---------------------------

* :file:`Makefile.in` has been corrected to use the parameters
  chosen by the :program:`configure` script


Tools changes
-------------

* :program:`fax2ps` has been rewritten and moved over from the user
  contributed software
* an uninitialized variable in :program:`pal2rgb` has been fixed
* :program:`ras2tiff` now converts 24-bit RGB raster data so that
  samples are written in the proper order
* :program:`tiff2ps` has been updated to include fixes
  and enhancements from Alberto Accomazzi
* :program:`tiffcp` now has a "``-o``" option to select a directory
  by file offset
* :program:`tiffinfo` is now capable of displaying the raw undecoded
  image data in a file
* :program:`tiffgt` has been rewritten to use the new ``TIFFRGBAImage``
  support and to handle multiple files
