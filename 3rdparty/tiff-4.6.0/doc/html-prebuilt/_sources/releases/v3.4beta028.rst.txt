This document describes the changes made to the software between the
*previous* and *current* versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.
The following information is located here:


Software configuration changes
------------------------------

* a "``-noninteractive``" flag was added to configure to
  control whether or not it prints and prompts for configuration information
* various typos and fixes were made in configure for the the
  library-only build support (this and other configure fixes from
  `Richard Mlynarik <mly@adoc.xerox.com>`_)
* bugs were fixed in the handling of pathnames supplied for external
  packages; e.g. ``DIR_JPEG``
* the handling of ``SETMAKE`` is now done properly
* the default prototype function declaration for :c:func:`pow` was corrected
* a bug was fixed in :file:`libtiff/Makefile.in` that caused installation
  to fail on systems without DSO support


Library changes
---------------

* Acorn RISC O/S support that was accidentally left out of the
  left out of the previous distribution is present (from Peter Greenham)
* complaints about unknown and/or unsupported codecs have been
  delayed until they are invoked; this permits applications to open
  images and look at tags even if the image data is compressed with
  an unknown/unsupported compression scheme
* bugs in handling unknown tags have been corrected; applications
  that use multiple codecs, each with codec-specific tags, no longer
  generate confusing error messages
* a missing pseudo-tag definition in the CCITT G3 codec was fixed
  (this problem caused core dumps in the :program:`tiffcp` program)
* pseudo-tags are now treated specially; they are always considered
  to be set (i.e. they do not use bits in the ``FIELD_*`` bit-vectors).
* the use of strip chopping can now be controlled on a per-file basis
  through a mode parameter supplied when opening a file ("``C``" to
  enable strip chopping and "``c``" to disable)
* two bugs were fixed in the writing of opposite-endian byte-order
  files
* support was added for three new fax-related tags registered to
  SGI: ``FaxRecvParams``, ``FaxRecvTime``, and ``FaxSubAddress``
* the bit order of image data read and written can now be controlled
  on a per-file basis through a mode parameter supplied when opening
  a file ("``B``" to force MSB2LSB bit order, "``L``" for LSB2MSB bit
  order, and "``H``" for the bit order of the native CPU)
* the byte order of image and tag data written to newly-created files
  can now be controlled on a per-file basis through a mode parameter
  supplied when opening a file ("``b``" to force Big-Endian byte order
  and "``l``" to force Little-Endian byte order)
* the use memory-mapped files for images opened read-only can now
  be controlled on a per-file basis through a mode parameter supplied
  when opening a file ("``M``" to enable use of memory-mapped files
  and "``m``" to disable use)
* the use of the :c:macro:`WIN32` define in :file:`tiffiop.h` has
  been replaced by :c:macro:`__WIN32__`


Tools changes
-------------

* :program:`fax2ps` now does a ``save`` and ``restore``
  around each page of PostScript; this fixes a problem with VM
  overflow when printing a many-page document on some printers
* a bug in the handling of 3-channel images by :program:`ras2tiff`
  was fixed
* :program:`tiffcp` has new options to control the byte order of
  newly created files: "``-B``" for Big-Endian byte order, "``-L``"
  for Little-Endian byte order; a "``-M``" option to disable the
  use of memory-mapped files, and a "``-C``" option to disable the
  use of strip chopping
* bugs were fixed in :program:`tiffcp` handling of codec-specific tags


Documentation changes
---------------------

* the :c:func:`TIFFOpen` page has been updated to reflect the new
  optional open mode parameters

Contributed software changes
----------------------------

* :file:`contrib/win95` contains information and code from `Philippe Tenenhaus
  <100423.3705@compuserve.com>`_
  about using the software under Windows 95
* :file:`contrib/winnt` contains information and code from `Dave Dyer
  <ddyer@triple-i.com>`_
  about using the software under Windows NT
