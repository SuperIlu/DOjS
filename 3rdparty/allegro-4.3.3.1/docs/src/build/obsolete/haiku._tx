Using Allegro

   Linking Allegro to a program also requires you to link several other Haiku
   libraries and set the correct library search pathes. To simplify the
   linking process, the installation sets up a script, <tt>allegro-config</tt>, that
   will print out a suitable commandline. You can use this inside backtick
   command substitution, for example:
<textblock>
      gcc myfile.c -o myprogram `allegro-config --static`
<endblock>
   This will enable you to link against the static library.

   The `<tt>allegro-config --shared</tt>` option mentioned above will output all the
   options and libraries needed to link dynamically against the shared
   version of the Allegro library. If you use <tt>--libs</tt> instead of <tt>--shared</tt> or
   <tt>--static</tt>, the script will generate the linking arguments according to the
   latest installed library version. You can also run these <tt>allegro-config</tt>
   commands on the commandline to see what exactly they do.

   If you want to build a debug version of your program, assuming that
   you have installed the debug version of Allegro, use:
<textblock>
      gcc myfile.c -o myprogram `allegro-config --libs debug`
<endblock>
   Terminal newbies, take note that these are ` backticks, not normal '
   quotes!

   There are also other switches for printing out the Allegro version number,
   or to override the install paths. Run <tt>allegro-config</tt> without any
   arguments for a full list of options.

   Don't forget that you need to use the <code>END_OF_MAIN()</code> macro right after
   your <code>main()</code> function!
