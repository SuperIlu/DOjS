This document describes the changes made to the software between the
*previous* and *current* versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.
The following information is located here:


Software configuration changes
------------------------------

* Corrected alpha versioning.  

* Removed distinction between alpha and release targets in :file:`Makefile.in`.

* Added release.stamp target, which tags cvs tree, and updates 
  :file:`RELEASE-DATE`

* Added ``releasediff`` target, which diffs tree with source as of
  date in :file:`RELEASE-DATE`
  
* Ticked up version to 3.5.2 (alpha 01 -- but I think we'll moving
  away from alpha/non-alpha distinctions). 


Library changes
---------------

* Added IRIX/gcc, and OSF/1 4.x support on behalf of 
  `Albert Chin-A-Young <china@thewrittenword.com>`_.

* Added :c:func:`TIFFReassignTagToIgnore` API on behalf of
  `Bruce Cameron <cameron@petris.com>`_.  Man page still pending.

* pre-remove :file:`so` link before softlink in ``LINUXdso`` action in
  :file:`libtiff/Makefile.in` to avoid failure on ``LINUXdso`` builds other than
  the first.

* Fixed problem with :c:func:`cvtcmap` in :file:`tif_getimage.c` modifying the
  colormaps owned by the TIFF handle itself when trying to fixup wrong
  (eight bit) colormaps.  Corrected by maintaining a private copy of
  the colormap. 

* Added :c:func:`TIFFReadRGBATile`/:c:func:`TIFFReadRGBAStrip` support in
  :file:`tif_getimage.c`.

* Applied "``a``" mode fix to :file:`tif_win32.c`/:c:func:`TIFFOpen` as suggested
  by `Christopher Lawton <clawton@mathworks.com>`_.

* Set ``O_BINARY`` for :file:`tif_unix.c` :c:func:`open` ... used on cygwin for instance.

* Added ``CYGWIN`` case in configure.

* Applied Francois Dagand's patch to handle fax decompression bug. 
  (sizes >= 65536 were failing) 


Contributed software changes
----------------------------

* Added :program:`addtiffo` (add overviews to a TIFF file) in contrib.  Didn't
  put it in tools since part of it is in C++.
