Overview
--------

The LibTIFF project uses `GitLab issues <https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/issues/>`_
to report and manage bugs and feature requests.

Please let us know when you find a problem or fix a bug.

Previously, the project used
`MapTools.org bugzilla <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=regexp&short_desc=.&product=libtiff&long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&long_desc=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=&keywords_type=allwords&keywords=&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&bug_status=CLOSED&emailtype1=substring&email1=&emailtype2=substring&email2=&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&votes=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&cmdtype=doit&order=Bug+Number&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=>`_
to track bugs. All remaining tickets in that bugzilla instance were
migrated to GitLab issues, and this system should no longer be used.
All bugs filed in a older bugzilla at
`RemoteSensing.org <http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/>`_ (pre-April 2008)
have unfortunately been lost.


Reporting a bug
---------------

If you think you've discovered a bug, please first check to see if it is
already known by looking at the list of already reported bugs. Also, please
verify that the problem is still reproducible with the current development
software from GitLab.

If you'd like to enter a new bug report, you can create a
`new GitLab issue <https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/issues/new/>`_

Of course, reporting bugs is no substitute for discussion.
Please see the :doc:`mailinglist` page for further details.


Reporting a security issue

If you'd like to inform us about some kind of security issue that should not
