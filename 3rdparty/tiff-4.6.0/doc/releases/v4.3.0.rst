This document provides a summary of significant changes made to the
software between the *previous* and *current* versions (see
above). A fully-detailed change summary is provided by the :file:`ChangeLog` file
included in the release package and by the Git commit history:

Major changes
-------------

* Build and usage of the library and its utilities requires a C99 capable
  compiler.

* New optional codec for the LERC (Limited Error Raster Compression) compression scheme.
  To have it available, configure libtiff against the SDK available at
  `<https://github.com/esri/lerc>`_

* CMake build: revamp of build scripts

Software configuration changes
------------------------------

* cmake: revamp of the cmake build scripts. There are impacts on the case of
  some options.

* cmake: update minimum version and policy version to 3.9.

* Remove NMake build support. The functionality provided by the NMake build
  is now completely superseded by the CMake build.

* Remove antiquated Scons and makefile.lcc build support.

* Remove non-functional VMS and WinCE support.

* :file:`autogen.sh` now updates :file:`config.guess` and :file:`config.sub` from master gnulib version.

Library changes
---------------

* Use of :c:type:`int8`, :c:type:`uint8`, :c:type:`int16`, :c:type:`uint16`,
  :c:type:`int32`, :c:type:`uint32`, :c:type:`int64`, :c:type:`uint64`
  typedefs is now deprecated. libtiff code and headers no longer use them,
  and use their C99 standard equivalents (with ``_t`` suffix). Those typedefs
  are still available, with deprecation warnings, but external code is strongly
  encouraged to use the corresponding C99 :file:`stdint.h` types. The deprecated
  types might be removed in a future release.

* Removal of unused, or now useless due to C99 availability, functions in :file:`port/`

* A few issues spotted by static code analysis tools fixed. Compiler
  warnings addressed.

Tools changes
-------------

* In usage text, insert a line of text summarizing each tool's purpose

* tiff tools: made display of compression methods and their parameters
  conditional on their actual availability

* :program:`tiff2ps`: exit the loop in case of error (#232)

* :program:`tiff2pdf`: check that tiff_datasize fits in a signed :c:type:`tsize_t` (#202)

* :program:`tiffsplit`: exit with :c:macro:`EXIT_FAILURE` if there are extra args on the command line

* :program:`tiffcmp`: fix comparaison with pixels that are fractional number of bytes (#53)

Contributed software changes
----------------------------

* :file:`iptcutil.c` - set ``#ifdef _WIN32`` (was ``#ifdef WIN32``, which failed at build time)
