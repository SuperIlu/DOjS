\section overview__intro Introduction

JasPer is a collection
of software (i.e., a library and application programs) for the
coding and manipulation of images.  This software can handle image
data in a variety of formats.  One such format supported by JasPer
is the JPEG-2000 format defined in ISO/IEC 15444-1.
This software was developed by
<a href="https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams">Michael Adams</a>
from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the 
University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.

\section overview__features Features

Some of the features of the JasPer library are as follows:

  - has multithreading support (e.g., the JasPer library can be used
    concurrently in multiple threads)
  - has native support for several image codecs, including:
      - JPEG-2000 JP2 File Format Syntax (ISO/IEC 15444-1)
      - JPEG-2000 Code Stream Syntax (ISO/IEC 15444-1)
      - Portable Graymap/Pixmap (PNM)
      - Microsoft Bitmap (BMP)
      - Sun Rasterfile (RAS)
      - JPEG-2000 VM Format (PGX)
  - has non-native support for the following image codecs:
      - JPEG (ISO/IEC 10918-1) via IJG JPEG Library
      - HEIC (ISO/IEC 23008-12) via the libheif Library
  - can add new codecs (or enable/disable codecs) at run time
  - can specify a memory allocator to be used by the library
  - can specify a logging function to be used by the library for
    error, warning, informational, and debugging messages
  - can place an upper limit on the total amount of memory that can be
    used by the library (which is useful in protecting against malicious
    image streams during decoding)
  - can decode from a non-seekable source stream (which is useful for
    filtering pipelines)
  - can manage ICC profiles
  - portable code, known to work on many platforms
    (e.g., Linux, Windows, MacOS, BSD, etc.)
  - can autodetect the image format during decoding

Several application programs are also provided:

  - `jasper`, an image transcoder program for converting between image formats
  - `imginfo`, a program for querying the properties of an image, such as:
    width, height, number of components, and the number of bits per sample
  - `imgcmp`, a program for comparing two images using various distance
    metrics, such as peak absolute error (PAE), mean absolute error (MAE), and
    peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR)
  - `jiv`, an image viewer

\section overview__news News

In release 3.0.0 of JasPer, the following notable changes were made to the API
and/or behavior of the library relative to earlier releases (and therefore
impact backward compatibility):

  - The `jas_init()` and `jas_cleanup()` functions have been marked as
    deprecated.
    The replacements for these functions are described in
    \ref lib_init.

  - The `jas_init()` function no longer registers `jas_cleanup()` as an atexit
    handler.
    So, the library user is now responsible for invoking `jas_cleanup()` at
    an appropriate time.
    This change was needed in order to better support the use of the JasPer
    library on some platforms.

  - In the I/O streams API, some of the integral types used in the
    parameter/return types of the following functions were changed to use
    @c size_t/@c ssize_t in order to address some longstanding API issues:

      - `jas_stream_memopen()`
      - `jas_stream_read()`
      - `jas_stream_write()`
      - `jas_stream_copy()`
      - `jas_stream_gobble()`
      - `jas_stream_copy()`
      - `jas_stream_pad()`

  - In the I/O streams API, in some cases where the integral type
    used was changed from a signed to unsigned type, deprecated
    behavior that allowed for negative values was removed.

  - The `jas_stream_memopen2()` function has been deprecated.

  - More effort has been made to hide functions/macros that are
    internal to the JasPer library in an effort to prevent applications
    using such functions/macros (which can lead to many types of
    problems).

As part of the work done in preparing the JasPer 3.0.0 release, support
for JasPer 3.0.0 was merged into the popular XV software, which can be
